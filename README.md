# Memory-Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This repository is a first collaborative attempt to learn and improve upon front-end technologies (such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript) by reproducing a **memory game**, which is based on the following tutorial [*How to Create a Memory Game in JavaScript*](https://www.webtips.dev/memory-game-in-javascript):

For this purpose, we have identified the following **tasks**: 

- [ ] Understand the **overall structure** of the source code
- [ ] Dissect the source code into its **main elements** according to its pertaining front-end technologies (such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
- [ ] Understand how they **interact** with one another for generating the final result (namely the memory game)
- [ ] Identify means of **running the application** both locally and in a web server
- [ ] Investigate options of extending (and therefore **individualizing**) the memory game

For a better comprehension and monitoring of our learning path for both internal and external purposes, the beforementioned tasks will be continuously **documented** in this readme file. The list of to-dos will be extended as deemed necessary.

## Introduction
The **motivation** for setting up this repository arose from a friendly first conversation at a summer party held by [Mariposa Boxing Club](https://www.bcmariposa.com/) on the 25th of June, 2022 in Munich where we discovered our interest for learning and delving deeper into programming (in particular with respect to front-end) out of personal and professional interest. While efforts for furthering our knowledge in this domain (such as completing MOOC courses and/or taking private tutoring) have proven fruitful for grasping key concepts, pursuing an individual and collaborative project for solving a real-world problem seems promising for taking our skills up a notch.

One real-world problem is setting up a **memory game** that others can access and play around with - while this game could be considered rather simple and trite, it nonetheless serves as an excellent starting point for acquiring skills necessary to create and appropriately set up an application (and for that matter also timeless and classic game) written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As this project evolves, additional features and extensions could allow us to increase the complexity of the underlying application and hence turn this project into a unique contribution to the vast array of already excellent beginner projects online that could potentially help inspire others eager to learn front-end programming in their first steps.
